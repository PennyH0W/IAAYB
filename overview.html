                    <h2>Janet's Journey</h2>
                    <p>Janet is a passionate belly dance instructor who has dedicated her life to teaching and inspiring others through the art of belly dance. After a life-changing car accident left her wheelchair and walker-bound, belly dancing became her pathway to recovery. The exercise, endurance, and motivation she gained through belly dance helped her overcome numerous fractures and a heart contusion. This transformative experience inspired Janet to write her book, <em>It's All About Your Belly</em>, and she has since appeared on several TV shows across the US to share her story and the healing power of dance.</p>
                    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
                    <p>Janet's main passion lies in teaching belly dance, and her classes cover a wide range of styles including Greek, Egyptian, SharQui, and various fusion forms that blend belly dance with country, hip-hop, burlesque, hula, Tahitian, and salsa. In addition to belly dancing, Janet is a certified Zumba and hula hoop instructor. She integrates yoga and stretching into her classes to enhance flexibility, prevent injuries, and ensure her students can fully enjoy the dance experience.</p>
                    <h2>Accessories & Music</h2>
                    <p>Janet's classes often feature the use of traditional dance accessories such as Isis Wings, veils, fan veils, zills, and Tahitian I'i's. The music accompanying her classes is as diverse as her dance styles, ranging from classical belly dancing music to Greek, Indian, country, hip-hop, reggae, salsa, Latin, folkloric, and beyond.</p>
