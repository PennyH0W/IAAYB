            <h2>A Linda Lombardi</h2>
            <p class="testimonial">                
                As a child I was always on the chunky side, so when my mother put me in a ballet and tap class at
                six-years-old, I was not exactly enthusiastic. To me I just saw another means for kids to tease me...especially in
                a leotard! But as fate would have it, I was actually good at dancing so I won the respect of the skinny little girls who had the bodies
                but lacked the ability. This small victory gave me the confidence to continue. By the time I was twelve I choreographed two
                dance routines for my school's sports night and continued to be the choreographer in high school. I had no idea that as an adult dance would
                lead me to the Highlight of my life: my husband. In 1989 a new Country bar called Tulsa opened up in my neighborhood. At the height of the country
                craze in 1985, I learned to do both couples and line dance, so I was intrigued by this new addition so close to home.
                I went with a girlfriend to learn new dances but when the instructors realized I had experience I
                started demonstrating new dances with Tom, one of the two instructors. At that time a handsome young man named Jim joined the class and picked
                up the moves very quickly so he became the occasional partner of the other instructor. Jim and I had danced together in class
                and became friends. One night I asked him if he would teach me the dance he did with Donna. He said he would only if I
                taught him the dance that I did with Tom. The dance that I taught him was called the "El Paso", a romantic cowboy cha cha. At one point in
                this dance the dancers look each other in the eyes while doing a dip move. That was the move that made the sparks fly! Two years later we were married
                and have been dancing happily through life for almost thirty years. And yes... We still do the El Paso!

                Dance isn’t something I do, it’s who I am. No matter how many times I try to walk away to explore
                other artistic avenues, the music continues to draw me in. My body moves, my mood shifts, and something inside me comes to
                life. It doesn’t have to take place on stage or in a class. It can go down right in my kitchen as I
                cook. All by myself. Or possibly an instantaneous dance-off in the family room with the kids. You want into my life and
                heart? Turn the music on and dance.

            <p class="testimonial">                
                Belly dance and me I started belly dancing on a whim with a friend, Lucy, from my neighborhood.
                We’d never done anything like that and thought it would be fun. It was interesting but the
                instructor was a bit all over the place and we weren’t really inspired to continue after a couple of months. Fast forward about 6 months and
                they started a belly dance class at our rec center in Oldsmar. My friend Lucy and I decided to try
                this class to see if it was something we could sink our teeth into. When we got there, there was my
                friend from work, Janet! What a surprise that was...we got a good laugh, small world, etc. and then
                got down to learning to belly dance with what has turned into a beautiful friendship and troupe.
                That was in 2008...wow. We did our first Hafla, kicking and screaming and much encouragement (and a
                shot...which became a tradition prior to shows) by our teacher, Angela, in 2009...we were all so
                scared to be doing “this!!!” in front of people!!!...what an exhilarating experience. Through these
                years of dancing many, many things have come and gone in my life; love, death, drama, breakups and
                everything in between. The consistency of our Monday night class has kept me sane, healthy, and
                loved through all of that and more. It has built up my tribal, country pop, hip-hop, Hawaiian and more...
                indeed a veritable cornucopia of dance styles and dress. Janet has been an amazing friend, teacher and confidant through all of this. 
                She consistently has been an inspiration to me in her ability to learn and perform always with a brilliant smile and attitude. 
                When Angela, our original teacher here in Oldsmar, decided she’d had enough and needed to move on, 
                Janet didn’t hesitate to step up and start teaching us. She has been committed to this troupe and the art. 
                She took time to become certified in Sharkee and is always thinking up new ways of inspiring and encouraging us to learn more, 
                be the healthiest we can be and hone our skills. When she got into a terrible car accident, 
                the first time she cried was when the doctor told her it was going to be months before she could dance again. 
                It hasn’t been a year since her accident and she's already back with a vengeance!
                This journey has been an awesome one that I intend on continuing for many more years to come.
                Besides, I have a closet full of fun costumes that need to be worn!!!

            <h2>Penny Howard</h2> 
            <p class="testimonial">            
                I have been Belly dancing for about 8 years now. Through all this time, this class has carried on through all of the obstacles and ups and downs in life, 
                that might have otherwise brought us down. It has also helped me to improve my overall self-esteem, posture, energy, and fitness. Before starting Belly dance, 
                I was the kind of person that was caught up in home and kids, and was overweight, and didn’t really take the time to think about my health or exercise. 
                I found myself to be lucky to have found this class through our local community center where my kids were attending summer camp. 
                Since then, Belly dance has really inspired me. I became more energetic, more motivated, and inspired to exercises, socialize, 
                and take better care of my health. Through this class, my self-esteem rose, my posture improved, I lost a lot of weight, and I made some really long-lasting friends. 
                I never thought that I would go from the one standing in the back of the class, to performing in full costume on stage with my belly dance sisters. 
                It has been wonderful. Belly dance has also helped me a lot with stress, mood, and emotional wellbeing. I find the movement of dance, the concentration and counting, 
                and just the sound of the music has tremendously reduced worry and stress, and enabled me to focus on the positive and constructive things that I enjoy. 
                I have also noticed the steady friendships have provided emotional support, and a consistency, which has been quite uplifting, There were times of struggle though... 
                when the class took breaks...when we weren’t sure that we would have the class to return to. During these times, there was something always missing. 
                Loss of instructor, losses in family, surgeries, health problems, and most recently, Janet's’ severe injuries that she sustained during a severe car accident 
                with multiple injuries and broken bones. It is remarkable how one can go from being hospitalized and then, bedbound and later wheelchair bound for a number of weeks, 
                even months, to walking multiple miles, and once again teaching our cherished belly dance class. I am very grateful to Janet for her passion, hard work, 
                and devotion with our belly dance Class. Thank you for keeping this class Tried and True, for having the class for us every week. 
                It has really been an inspiration to all of us. I truly am thankful.

            <p class="testimonial">                
                As a child I grew up dirt poor, in an abusive environment. I watched so many kids grow up with so much while I was so embarrassed to have nothing. 
                I developed many heath issues that probably stemmed from the neglect which carried through my young adult life. 
                Without the proper guidance I also brought with me into adult life severe depression, lack of self confidence and I was so lost, I had no purpose. 
                It had always been extremely hard for me to connect with people and develop friendships. Only through art, music and creativity did I find some peace. 
                At the age of 37 I attended my first drum circle, I saw people dancing wearing a belly dance coin scarf. I wanted one, 
                I decided to buy a few but I also decided if I was going to wear a belly dance hip scarf I would learn how to belly dance and so I did. 
                I had no idea by doing so my whole life was about to change for the better and bring me on a new path in my life where 
                I could be happy, healthy, enhance my creative side, and make friends (who I now call my dance sisters). 
                Belly dance has saved my life! I felt dead and damaged for so long but now I feel alive. Dance is a universal language, 
                no words necessary. 10 years later. I'm still belly dancing and will always be, it is the only consistent thing in my life that 
                I am really proud of. Never in a million years would I have though I would be a belly dancer But I’m glad I did!! 
                I found my self confidence, my light, and my place in this world. Through this path, 
                it has led me to other creative avenues such as fire dancing, cosplay and finding my purpose in this world 
                which is to inspire others to hold on to hope and never give up on finding happiness.

            <p class="testimonial">
                    When I was growing up I had an aunt who was a belly dancer by profession. I loved her costumes and the sound of the coins and cymbals as she shimmied along. 
                    It was something I always wanted to do, but never thought I could or should. Joining Leonard’s Ladies was the perfect way to get out of that negative mindset 
                    and just have fun. It was great mentally and physically at a time when I needed a boost in my self esteem and a way to get some exercise that was fun. 
                    Exercise was not something I was doing much or at all. Belly dancing is something anyone can do. The sounds from the coins on my skirts will always bring back great memories!

                    “Since the age of six I was involved in dance in one form or another. In my younger years it was the highlight of my lifestyle 
                    and the experiences affected me for a lifetime including to become a teacher sharing my love of Dance and arts with others. 
                    As a teacher it has enriched my life and blessed me with the opportunity to help shape and grow young students into talented artists. 
                    The impact of dance and art in our lives goes beyond words in expanding our minds in the experiences of 
                    expressionism, fortitude, fearlessness, self empowerment, creativity, responsibility, collaboration and so much more. 
                    I have been honored to have this opportunity and blessed in the smiles I see everyday from students past & present 
                    and seeing so many children and young adults go on to appreciate and participate in the arts in their future.”

                “Dance has been the instrument to share emotions for all cultures and as a teacher is good to see the impact that dance can project on any individual, 
                when you teach couples the passion comes alive relationships get more passionate. Dance is about making your partner feel beautiful on the dance floor, 
                dance is about feeling beautiful, sensual about yourself. Dance is about communicating to those watching the beauty of humanity,

                Having shared a large part of my life with a person who had dedicated many years of her life to dance and being exposed to many others who love the art of dance, 
                I've recognized they all seem to share common qualities. They are selfless, giving people. They sacrifice for their chosen form of dance. 
                They are welcoming of other people and have a great willingness to share and teach. They are joyful. My dearest Janet embodies all these qualities and mane more.
                I love reading her story (and her!)!
